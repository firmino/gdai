# About G-DAI

G-DAI was created to address the growing need for trustworthy, explainable, and scalable document search and question-answering systems. As organizations increasingly rely on large collections of documents, ensuring that answers are both accurate and auditable becomes critical.

## Vision
To empower organizations with a platform that not only delivers precise answers but also provides full transparency into the sources and reasoning behind those answers.

## Core Principles
- **Transparency**: Every answer is traceable to its source.
- **Scalability**: Designed for multi-tenant environments and large document collections.
- **Flexibility**: Supports various semantic and retrieval techniques.
- **Community-Driven**: Open to contributions and improvements from the community.

## Acknowledgements
G-DAI builds upon open-source technologies such as PostgreSQL, pgvector, FastAPI, and modern NLP/LLM frameworks.
